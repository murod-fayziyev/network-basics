# What Is the Internet?

The Internet is a global network that connects billions of devices around the world.
These devices, called end systems or hosts, communicate with each other using packet switching.

The Internet is built from:
- End systems (computers, smartphones, servers)
- Communication links (fiber, copper, wireless)
- Packet switches (routers and switches)

Data is not sent as a single piece. Instead, it is divided into small packets.
Each packet travels through the network and is reassembled at the destination.

From another perspective, the Internet is an infrastructure that provides services to applications
such as web browsing, email, messaging, video streaming, and online games.
