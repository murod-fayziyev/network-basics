# Packet Switching

Packet switching is a method used by the Internet to send data between devices.
Instead of sending data as one large block, the data is divided into small packets.

Each packet can take a different path through the network.
Routers forward packets independently based on destination addresses.

At the destination, packets are reassembled to form the original data.
Packet switching makes the Internet efficient, scalable, and reliable.
