# TCP/IP Overview

TCP/IP is the core protocol suite of the Internet.
It defines how data is formatted, transmitted, and received between devices.

IP (Internet Protocol) is responsible for addressing and routing packets
from the source to the destination.

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ensures reliable data delivery.
It handles packet ordering, retransmission, and error control.

Together, TCP and IP enable end systems to communicate
over different networks as one global Internet.
